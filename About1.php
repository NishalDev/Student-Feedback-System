					<p>We have developed a Student Feedback System, which is designed to gather feedback from students
						regarding their educational experience and the performance of faculty members.</p>
					<p>The main objective of the Student Feedback System is to provide a platform for students to
						express their opinions and provide constructive feedback on various aspects of their education.
						This system aims to capture valuable insights from students and utilize them to improve the
						quality of education and faculty performance.</p>
					<p>To use the system, students are required to create an account through the registration process.
						Once registered, students can access the system and provide feedback on the professors who are
						teaching their courses in each semester.</p>
					<p>The feedback system allows students to rate the faculty members based on different categories
						such as knowledge level, teaching methodology, communication skills, responsiveness, and overall
						performance. The feedback options may include ratings like excellent, good, average, below
						average, and poor.</p>
					<p>In addition to providing feedback, students can also view their own feedback history and track
						their previous evaluations. Faculty members, on the other hand, can log in to the system to view
						the feedback they have received from students for their respective courses. This helps faculty
						members to gauge their performance, identify areas for improvement, and take necessary actions
						to enhance their teaching methodologies.</p>
					<p>The system also provides an administrative interface for the Head of the Department (HOD) or the
						designated administrator. The administrator has the authority to add or remove faculty members
						from the system. They can also access all the feedback given by students and generate reports to
						analyze the overall feedback trends and performance evaluations.</p>
